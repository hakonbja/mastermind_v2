This is my version of the board game Mastermind from the 70's. The original is meant for two players, the codemaker and the codebreaker, but here you play alone as the codebreaker against the computer.

The "v2" refers to when I wrote this game for the first time 1.5 years ago with JS and jQuery. This version is built as a simple React app.
