This is my take on the board game Mastermind from the 70's. The original is meant for two players, the codemaker and the codebreaker, but here you play alone as the codebreaker against the computer.

I built this game first in the beginning of 2018 (hence the "v2") with JavaScript and jQuery. This version is built with React.
